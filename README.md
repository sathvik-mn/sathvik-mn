👋 Hi, I'm @sathvik-mn,

👀 I have a deep passion for data analysis and statistical modeling, with a particular talent for bringing data to life through compelling visualizations. My interests extend beyond mainstream data science to encompass astrophysics, archaeology, and the evolution of human civilization.

🌱 Currently, I'm advancing my knowledge in machine learning within the realm of data science, eager to explore the cutting-edge of this dynamic field.

💞️ I'm open to collaborations that challenge me and push the boundaries of what we can achieve with data.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me at sathvikmn2022@gmail.com for any inquiries or opportunities to connect.

⚡ Fun fact: I endeavor to provide data-driven answers for every question posed to me. Oops, sorry, I can't help it!
