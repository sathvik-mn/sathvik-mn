NAMASTEüôè, I'm Sathvik Maridasana Nagaraj,

I have a deep passion for data analysis and statistical modeling, with a particular talent for bringing data to life through compelling visualizations. My interests extend beyond mainstream data science to encompass astrophysics, archaeology, and the evolution of human civilization.

Currently, I'm advancing my knowledge in Machine Learning & Statistical Modelling within the realm of data science, eager to explore the cutting-edge of this dynamic field.

I'm open to collaborations that challenge me and push the boundaries of what we can achieve with data.

Feel free to reach out to me at sathvikmn98@gmail.com or sathvikmn2022@gmail.com for any inquiries or opportunities to connect.
